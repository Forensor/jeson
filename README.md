</p>

Jeson Mor (Nine Horses) is a two-player strategy board game from Mongolia played on a 9Ã—9 checkered gameboard. Each player has nine chess knights initially lined up on the first ranks. A player wins by being first to occupy the central square (red circle above) with a knight, and then leave that square. Knights move as in normal chess (see below).
